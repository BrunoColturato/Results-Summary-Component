## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- CSS Attribute Selectors

### What I learned

With this project I had my first contact with CSS atribute selectors and I found them amazing! 

```css
.grid-flow[data-spacing="small"] {
  gap: 0.8rem;
}
```

I also learned to use CSS custom properties inside an element and not only in the `:root` pseudo-class.

```css
.result-summary {
  --padding: 2rem;
  --border-radius: 2rem;
  max-width: 40rem;
  display: grid;
}
```
